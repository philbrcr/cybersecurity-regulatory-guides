# **NIST 800-171 Compliance Assessment Template** 

## Introduction

This **NIST 800-171 Compliance Assessment Template** is designed to help organizations assess their compliance with the NIST 800-171 framework, identify gaps, and track progress toward compliance. The template covers the 14 control families from the NIST 800-171 guidelines and includes spaces for organizations to document current practices, necessary actions, responsible parties, and timelines.

| **Maintenance (MA)** | Addresses the regular maintenance and patching of systems. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **Media Protection (MP)** | Ensures that CUI is stored on physical and electronic media and is secure. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **Personnel Security (PS)** | Ensures that personnel who handle CUI have appropriate background checks and security clearances. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **Physical Protection (PE)** | Secures physical access to systems that store or process CUI. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **Risk Assessment (RA)** | Focuses on assessing and mitigating cybersecurity risks. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **Security Assessment (CA)** | Evaluates the effectiveness of security controls. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **System and Communications Protection (SC)** | Protects information in transit and ensures secure system communication. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |
| **System and Information Integrity (SI)** | Ensures system vulnerabilities are detected and mitigated. | <li>-[ ] Yes </li> <li>- [ ] No</li> <li>-[ ] Partial</li>  |  |

### 2\. Gap Analysis and Action Plan

This section will provide an example on how organizations can assess the **gaps** in their current practices and develop an **action plan** to address them.

| Control Family | Identified Gaps | Required Actions | Responsible Party | Timeline | Completion Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Access Control (AC)** | Lack of multi-factor authentication for critical systems. | Implement multi-factor authentication for all systems handling CUI. | IT Security Team | 30 days | In progress |
| **Awareness and Training (AT)** | No regular security awareness training for employees. | Schedule and deliver biannual security training. | HR/Training Dept. | 60 days | Not started |
| **Audit and Accountability (AU)** | No log retention policy for user access. | Implement log retention for 90 days, focusing on CUI access logs. | IT Operations | 45 days | Pending |
| **Configuration Management (CM)** | Outdated system configurations. | Perform system configuration audits and update them as needed. | IT Team | 90 days | In progress |

### 3\. Action Plan Tracker

This example tracker will help organizations monitor the progress of all actions over time, ensuring that compliance measures are met on schedule.

| Action Item | Control Family | Action Description | Assigned To | Start Date | End Date | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Implement MFA for critical systems | Access Control | Implement multi-factor authentication for all systems handling CUI. | IT Security Team | 01/01/2024 | 01/30/2024 | In Progress |
| Conduct regular security awareness training | Awareness and Training | Schedule and deliver biannual security training for all employees. | HR Department | 01/15/2024 | 02/15/2024 | Not Started |
| Conduct an audit of current system configurations | Configuration Management | Audit and update system configurations to meet security standards. | IT Department | 01/20/2024 | 02/20/2024 | Pending |
| Implement CUI media encryption | Media Protection | Encrypt all portable media storing CUI. | IT Security Team | 02/01/2024 | 03/01/2024 | Pending |

### 4\. Ongoing Monitoring and Review

This section will guide the organization in monitoring and reviewing its ongoing compliance efforts.

| Control Family | Monitoring Actions | Responsible Party | Frequency | Status |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Access Control (AC)** | Review user access logs to ensure compliance with access policies. | IT Security Team | Monthly | Ongoing |
| **Incident Response (IR)** | Regularly review incident response drills and update procedures as needed. | Incident Response Team | Quarterly | Ongoing |
| **Configuration Management (CM)** | Conduct quarterly reviews of system configurations and apply patches. | IT Team | Quarterly | Ongoing |

### 5\. Conclusion

The NIST 800-171 Compliance Assessment Template allows organizations to effectively track and manage their cybersecurity posture in relation to the NIST 800-171 guidelines. Using this tool, your organization can systematically identify weaknesses, implement corrective actions, and ensure compliance is achieved and maintained.

---

## Next Steps

* Regularly update the action items and track progress on the assessment.  
* Assign new responsibilities as required to ensure continuous improvement in security practices.  
* Ensure regular reviews are conducted to adapt to new threats and changes in the NIST 800-171 guidelines.

## Instructions for Use

1. **Complete the Assessment**: For each control family, review the current status and mark whether your organization is fully compliant, partially compliant, or non-compliant.  
2. **Identify Gaps**: Where gaps are identified, document the specific issues and create action items to address them.  
3. **Assign Responsibilities**: Assign each action item to the relevant team or individual and set a clear timeline for completion.  
4. **Monitor and Review**: Continuously track progress and update action item status to ensure compliance is achieved and maintained.
