# **NIST 800-171 Guide: Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)**

## Introduction

**[NIST 800-171](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/171/r3/final)** is a set of standards developed by the **[National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)](https://www.nist.gov/)** to protect **Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)** in non-federal systems and organizations. It is part of the **[Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cyber-threats-and-advisories/federal-information-security-modernization-act)** framework and is primarily relevant to contractors and subcontractors working with the U.S. government.

This guide will explain the core principles behind **NIST 800-171**, break down its 14 control families, and offer practical steps for achieving compliance.

## Why NIST 800-171 Matters

NIST 800-171 was designed to ensure that CUI, which is sensitive but unclassified information, remains protected in accordance with federal cybersecurity requirements. While federal agencies must adhere to strict cybersecurity standards, contractors and other non-federal organizations that handle CUI must follow these guidelines to safeguard national security interests and comply with federal requirements.

**Key Reasons for Compliance:**

* **Legal and Contractual Obligations**: Many government contracts require NIST 800-171 adherence.  
* **Risk Reduction**: Protecting CUI helps minimize the risk of data breaches, cyberattacks, and insider threats.  
* **Reputation**: Maintaining a high level of security can enhance your reputation as a trusted partner for government contracts.

## NIST 800-171 Core Control Families

The NIST 800-171 document breaks down its requirements into **14 control families**, each addressing a different aspect of cybersecurity. Here’s an overview of each family:

### 1\. Access Control (AC)

This family focuses on controlling access to information and systems.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Limit system access to authorized users based on need-to-know and job responsibilities.  
  * Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to sensitive systems.  
  * Maintain and regularly review access control lists.

### 2\. Awareness and Training (AT)

This family outlines requirements for training staff on security procedures and raising awareness about cybersecurity risks.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Provide ongoing security awareness training to all employees.  
  * Train users to recognize and respond to cybersecurity threats like phishing.

### 3\. Audit and Accountability (AU)

Audit logs and accountability are necessary for detecting and investigating security incidents.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Maintain logs of user activities and system operations.  
  * Implement audit trails to track access to sensitive CUI.

### 4\. Configuration Management (CM)

This family addresses the importance of maintaining secure configurations for systems and software.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Establish and maintain baseline configurations for all systems.  
  * Control changes to configurations and ensure unauthorized changes are detected.

### 5\. Identification and Authentication (IA)

Identification and authentication ensure that only authorized individuals can access systems.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Implement strong user authentication mechanisms.  
  * Ensure unique identifiers for every user accessing CUI systems.

### 6\. Incident Response (IR)

Incident response focuses on identifying, responding to, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Develop and implement an incident response plan.  
  * Train staff to recognize and report incidents promptly.

### 7\. Maintenance (MA)

This family addresses the proper maintenance of security controls and systems.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Regularly update and patch systems.  
  * Ensure all maintenance procedures follow security protocols.

### 8\. Media Protection (MP)

Protecting physical and electronic media is crucial to preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Encrypt sensitive data on media (e.g., hard drives, USB drives).  
  * Implement measures to prevent unauthorized access to media and ensure proper disposal when no longer needed.

### 9\. Personnel Security (PS)

Personnel security focuses on ensuring that employees have the appropriate and trustworthy clearances.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Screen personnel before granting access to sensitive information.  
  * Terminate access to CUI when employees leave or change roles.

### 10\. Physical Protection (PE)

This family involves securing physical access to systems and facilities.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Control physical access to systems where CUI is processed or stored.  
  * Implement security controls like locks, badges, and visitor logs.

### 11\. Risk Assessment (RA)

Regular risk assessments are essential to identify, evaluate, and address cybersecurity risks.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Conduct periodic risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities.  
  * Implement corrective actions based on assessment results.

### 12\. Security Assessment (CA)

Security assessments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security measures.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Regularly test security controls and ensure they are operating as intended.  
  * Address findings from security assessments promptly.

### 13\. System and Communications Protection (SC)

This family covers how data and systems are protected from cybersecurity threats during communications and interactions.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Ensure secure communication channels for CUI transfer (e.g., encryption).  
  * Protect systems from unauthorized remote access.

### 14\. System and Information Integrity (SI)

System integrity ensures that systems function as intended without unauthorized interference.

* **Key Requirements**:  
  * Use tools to detect and correct system flaws and vulnerabilities.  
  * Continuously monitor system integrity to prevent exploitation.

## Implementing NIST 800-171

### 1\. Conduct a Gap Analysis

The first step in implementing NIST 800-171 is to conduct a **gap analysis**, comparing your current cybersecurity posture with the requirements in the framework. Identify and document areas where your organization is not meeting NIST’s standards.

### 2\. Develop an Action Plan

Based on the gap analysis, create an action plan that outlines specific steps to close the gaps. This should include:

* Assigning responsibilities for each control family.  
* Prioritizing remediation based on the severity and risk of non-compliance.  
* Establishing a timeline for implementing the necessary changes.

### 3\. Implement Security Controls

Once the action plan is in place, implement the required security controls. This may involve:

* Updating policies and procedures.  
* Installing or updating technical solutions (e.g., firewalls, encryption, MFA).  
* Providing training and awareness programs for staff.

## 4\. Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance

NIST 800-171 compliance is an ongoing process. Regularly assess and audit the effectiveness of implemented controls. Schedule periodic reviews to ensure that systems remain compliant and protected.

### 5\. Document Compliance

Thoroughly document all security controls, risk assessments, training programs, and audits. The documentation should be regularly updated to reflect any system changes or improvements.
