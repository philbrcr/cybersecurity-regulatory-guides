# **GDPR Compliance Guide**

## **Summary**

The **[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/)** is a data privacy law that protects the personal data of individuals in the **[European Union (EU)](https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en)** and the **European Economic Area (EEA)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area)**. It applies to any organization, regardless of location, that processes or stores data of EU residents.

The regulation aims to:

* Give individuals control over their data  
* Simplify the regulatory environment for international businesses  
* Ensure organizations handle personal data responsibly

Non-compliance can result in severe fines—up to **€20 million** or **4% of annual global revenue**, whichever is higher.

## Who It Applies To

GDPR applies to any organization that:

* Operates in the EU/EEA  
* Offers goods or services to EU/EEA residents (even if the organization is outside the EU)  
* Monitors or processes the personal data of EU/EEA residents

**Examples:**  
✅ An e-commerce website based in the U.S. selling to EU customers  
✅ A SaaS company monitoring EU user behavior via analytics tools  
✅ A healthcare provider storing EU patient records

---

## Key Terms

To understand GDPR, here are a few important definitions:

* **Personal Data:** Any information relating to an identified or identifiable person (e.g., name, email, IP address, location).  
* **Data Subject:** The individual whose data is being processed.  
* **Data Controller:** The entity that determines why and how data is processed.  
* **Data Processor:** The entity that processes data on behalf of the controller.  
* **Processing:** Any operation performed on personal data (e.g., collection, storage, analysis, deletion).

## [Compliance Steps](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

### Step 1: Assess Your Data

* Map out what personal data you collect, process, or store.  
* Identify the purpose and legal basis for processing each type of data.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Data audit to determine where personal data is stored (databases, CRMs, spreadsheets)  
✅ Record processing activities (required under Article 30\)

---

### Step 2: Update Privacy Policies

* Create a transparent, user-friendly **Privacy Policy** outlining:  
  * What data do you collect  
  * Why you collect it  
  * How long you keep it  
  * Who do you share it with

**Example Statement:**  
"We collect your email address to provide updates on our services. Your data is securely stored and deleted after 12 months."

---

### Step 3: Obtain User Consent

* Ensure users explicitly **opt into** data collection, with a clear option to opt-out.  
* Avoid pre-ticked boxes or ambiguous consent.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Add consent checkboxes for email subscriptions and cookies  
✅ Enable easy withdrawal of consent (e.g., unsubscribe links)

---

### Step 4: Implement Data Protection Measures

* Encrypt personal data (at rest and in transit).  
* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can access sensitive data.  
* Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** for high-risk data processing.

**Tools:**

* Data encryption software  
* GDPR-compliant access management tools

---

### Step 5: Establish Data Breach Protocols

* Develop a process to detect, report, and respond to data breaches.  
* Notify supervisory authorities within **72 hours** of discovering a breach.  
* Inform affected individuals if the breach risks their rights and freedoms.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Incident response plan in place  
✅ Data breach notification templates ready

---

### Step 6: Respect Data Subject Rights

Ensure processes are in place to fulfill the following individual rights:

1. **Right to Access:** Individuals can request access to their data.  
2. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** Individuals can request data deletion.  
3. **Right to Rectification:** Individuals can correct inaccurate data.  
4. **Right to Data Portability:** Individuals can receive their data in a machine-readable format.  
5. **Right to Object:** Individuals can object to data processing (e.g., marketing emails).

## Supporting Notes

* Use the **Legal Basis** field to align with GDPR's 6 lawful bases:  
  1. **Consent** (e.g., newsletter subscriptions)  
  2. **Contract** (e.g., data needed to deliver services)  
  3. **Legal Obligation** (e.g., tax data)  
  4. **Vital Interests**  
  5. **Public Task**  
  6. **Legitimate Interests**  
* Your data **Retention Periods** must match your policies. Be specific (e.g., “12 months” instead of “short term”).  
* The **Data Breach Risk** field helps prioritize which datasets require stronger security measures.
