## [Compliance Steps](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/)

### Step 1: Assess Your Data

* Map out what personal data you collect, process, or store.  
* Identify the purpose and legal basis for processing each type of data.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Data audit to determine where personal data is stored (databases, CRMs, spreadsheets)  
✅ Record processing activities (required under Article 30\)

---

### Step 2: Update Privacy Policies

* Create a transparent, user-friendly **Privacy Policy** outlining:  
  * What data do you collect  
  * Why you collect it  
  * How long you keep it  
  * Who do you share it with

**Example Statement:**  
"We collect your email address to provide updates on our services. Your data is securely stored and deleted after 12 months."

---

### Step 3: Obtain User Consent

* Ensure users explicitly **opt into** data collection, with a clear option to opt-out.  
* Avoid pre-ticked boxes or ambiguous consent.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Add consent checkboxes for email subscriptions and cookies  
✅ Enable easy withdrawal of consent (e.g., unsubscribe links)

---

### Step 4: Implement Data Protection Measures

* Encrypt personal data (at rest and in transit).  
* Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict who can access sensitive data.  
* Conduct **Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs)** for high-risk data processing.

**Tools:**

* Data encryption software  
* GDPR-compliant access management tools

---

### Step 5: Establish Data Breach Protocols

* Develop a process to detect, report, and respond to data breaches.  
* Notify supervisory authorities within **72 hours** of discovering a breach.  
* Inform affected individuals if the breach risks their rights and freedoms.

**Checklist:**  
✅ Incident response plan in place  
✅ Data breach notification templates ready

---

### Step 6: Respect Data Subject Rights

Ensure processes are in place to fulfill the following individual rights:

1. **Right to Access:** Individuals can request access to their data.  
2. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** Individuals can request data deletion.  
3. **Right to Rectification:** Individuals can correct inaccurate data.  
4. **Right to Data Portability:** Individuals can receive their data in a machine-readable format.  
5. **Right to Object:** Individuals can object to data processing (e.g., marketing emails).
