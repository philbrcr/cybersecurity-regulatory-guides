# **GDPR Data Mapping Template**

## Overview

This template helps organizations comply with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** by mapping their data processing activities. It is a practical tool for understanding what data is collected, why it is processed, and how it is managed.

Under GDPR, organizations must document all personal data they collect, process, and store. This data mapping exercise is essential for the following:

* Identifying and mitigating risks.  
* Ensuring compliance with GDPR principles.  
* Responding to data subject access requests (DSARs).

## What is Data Mapping?

Data mapping involves **documenting the lifecycle of personal data** in your organization, including:

* The **source** of the data.  
* How and why it is **processed**.  
* Where it is **stored**.  
* Who has **access** to it?  
* What security measures **protect** it?
