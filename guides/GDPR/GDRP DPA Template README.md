# **GDPR Data Processing Agreement (DPA) Template README** 
## Overview:

A **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)** is a contractual document required under GDPR when a controller (the organization collecting personal data) works with processors (third-party vendors) that process personal data on their behalf. This template helps organizations create a standardized DPA, ensuring compliance with GDPR requirements.
