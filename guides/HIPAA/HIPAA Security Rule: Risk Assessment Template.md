# **HIPAA Security Rule: Risk Assessment Template** 
This template helps organizations assess risks to electronically Protected Health Information (ePHI) as the HIPAA Security Rule requires.

## \[Organization Name\] HIPAA Security Risk Assessment

### Identify Systems That Handle ePHI

* List all systems (e.g., servers, databases, workstations) that store, transmit, or receive ePHI.

| System Name | Description | ePHI Stored/Transmitted | Risk Level (High/Medium/Low) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Example System 1 | Server for Patient Data | <li>- [ ] Yes</li> <li>- [ ] No </li> | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li> |
| Example System 2 | Employee Workstation | <li>- [ ] Yes</li> <li>- [ ] No </li> | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  |

### Identify Vulnerabilities and Threats

* Assess potential threats that could impact ePHI, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and system failures.

| Vulnerability/Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Weak password policies | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  | Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). |
| Unencrypted data transmission | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  | Use encryption for data in transit. |

### Evaluate Security Controls

* Assess current security measures and their effectiveness in protecting ePHI.

| Control Measure | Implemented (Yes/No) | Effectiveness Rating (1-5) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Encryption for data at rest | <li>- [ ] Yes</li> <li>- [ ] No </li> | <li>- [ ] 1 </li> <li>- [ ] 2 </li> <li>- [ ] 3 </li> <li>- [ ] 4 </li> <li>- [ ] 5 </li> |
| Access Control Mechanisms | <li>- [ ] Yes</li> <li>- [ ] No </li> | <li>- [ ] 1 </li> <li>- [ ] 2 </li> <li>- [ ] 3 </li> <li>- [ ] 4 </li> <li>- [ ] 5 </li> |

---

### Plan for Remediation

* For each vulnerability, define the remediation steps.

| Vulnerability/Threat | Remediation Steps | Priority (High/Medium/Low) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Weak password policies | Implement password complexity rules and MFA. | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  |
| Unencrypted data transmission | Implement end-to-end encryption for all communications. | <li>- [ ] High </li> <li>-[ ] Medium</li> <li>- [ ] Low </li>  |
