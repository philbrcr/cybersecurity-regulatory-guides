# **Cybersecurity Posture Assessment Template**

## Overview

This template provides a structured approach to assessing an organization's cybersecurity posture. The goal is to identify strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement across key cybersecurity domains. This assessment can serve as a baseline for organizations preparing for frameworks like the **Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)**, **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**, or similar industry standards.

## Instructions

* Assess whether your organization complies, partially, or is non-compliant with the listed requirements for each domain.  
* Use the following scale to evaluate:  
  * **Compliant (C)**: Fully meets the requirement.  
  * **Partially Compliant (PC)**: This meets part of the requirement but has gaps.  
  * **Non-Compliant (NC)**: Does not meet the requirement.
